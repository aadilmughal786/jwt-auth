| 200         | **OK:** The request has succeeded, and the server has returned the requested data or performed the requested action. This is a standard response for successful HTTP requests.                                                                   |
| 201         | **Created:** The server has successfully fulfilled a POST request, and as a result, a new resource has been created. Typically, this status code is returned along with information about the newly created resource in the response body.       |
| 204         | **No Content:** The server has successfully fulfilled the request, but there is no additional data to be sent in the response body. This is often used for DELETE requests or actions that don't return data.                                    |
| 400         | **Bad Request:** The server cannot understand or process the client's request due to malformed syntax or invalid parameters. This code is often returned when the request lacks required data or contains incorrect data.                        |
| 401         | **Unauthorized:** The request requires user authentication. The server has received the request, but the user's credentials are either missing or invalid. The client is typically required to provide valid credentials to access the resource. |
| 403         | **Forbidden:** The server understands the request but refuses to fulfill it. This status code is often used for authentication and authorization purposes when a user lacks the necessary permissions to access a resource.                      |
| 404         | **Not Found:** The requested resource could not be found on the server. This is commonly returned when the URL path does not correspond to an existing resource.                                                                                 |
| 500         | **Internal Server Error:** A generic error message indicating that something unexpected went wrong on the server's side. This status code is used when no more specific error message is suitable.                                               |
| 502         | **Bad Gateway:** The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server it accessed. It indicates that the server acting as a gateway received an invalid response from the upstream server.      |
| 503         | **Service Unavailable:** The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. It is typically a temporary condition.                                                                  |
| 504         | **Gateway Timeout:** The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server or some other auxiliary server it needed to access.                                                              |
